# THREE.js Learning Repository

Welcome to the **THREE.js Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains all the code, notes, and experiments I’ve done while learning THREE.js — a powerful 3D JavaScript library used for creating stunning visuals and 3D web experiences.

## 📚 What is THREE.js?

[THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
